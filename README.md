# PORTO SCRIPTS
## Repository contains python and shell scrips in order to perform different tasks.
The scripts are used to solve following tasks in half-automated way: 
1. Creating Force Fields for molecules, using gaff2 via antechamber package and RESP charges calculated using G09 software.
2. Building simulation boxes - in water, octanol.
3. Perform analysis of trajectories from MD simulations, calculation of SASA.
4. Building biphasic octanol/water system + molecule MOL in octanol phase
5. Generating configurations for umbrella sampling procedure
6. Setting up .mdp files for umbrella sampling procedure
7. Setting up .sh files for seperate sampling windows to be launched
